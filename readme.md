# whom

Get the fullname of the current user at all costs necessary.

Based off of [Sindre Sorhus's fullname](https://github.com/sindresorhus/fullname)
and the passwd-user library used therein.

## Using

I made this as a start in writing Rust, so it's not useful as-is.
If you want to use it, you'll need to compile with Cargo and then run the binary.

``` sh
cargo build --release
```

`whom` will now be available as an executable in "target/release".
